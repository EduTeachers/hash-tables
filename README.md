# Set

Split into groups of three. Every member will have a dedicated role:

- [ ] **Implement the "Linear Probing"** data structure
- [ ] **Implement the "Hash Table"** data structure
- [ ] **Implement tests** for both data structures. **You can implement them before**, 
 the above implementations are ready.

## How to work:

1. Each of you will create a separate branch, where you will implement your "feature".
2. After your implementation is done, you will create a pull request, where you will invite the rest of the group
 (including me) to do a code review.
3. Once everybody approves your pull request, merge it into master.
